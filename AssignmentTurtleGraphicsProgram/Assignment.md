Your Task:
For this assignment you are required to develop a programmatic solution, using the Java
programming language, to the problem below. You will be required to produce a YouTube
demonstration video according to a provided Google Form Script, which MUST be
shown being filled in in he video. The video must be uploaded to your student
YouTube account and the link pasted into the submission box. Note that some aspects
of this assignment, notably the more advanced marks in a section, may require that you find
out for yourself how to achieve a solution.

Overview
The overall aim of this assignment is to implement a simple graphics tool. This must be built
as a graphical application using the Java Swing and/or AWT classes. The software will allow
users to type in simple commands which cause a virtual pen (sometimes it is also called a
turtle after the Logo programming language which was popular in schools in the 1980s) to
move around a virtual canvas area drawing lines as it moves.

Requirement 1 – basic application 20 marks

The first requirement is to produce a Java project which uses OOPGraphics, which is
provided in a jar file available on the OOP myBeckett page, under Assessments. This
class will do all the drawing and displaying when your class calls its methods (ensure
you always have the latest version of the jar file, as with any software it may be
updated). There is also documentation for this class in the same place on myBeckett,
which has simple instructions on how to use it. Note this documentation shows
facilities that will be of use and some that may not be needed and seem confusing
(just like the standard Java documentation).

Mark Breakdown
Project complete using the provided Jar file OOPGraphics.jar. Your project should also have
a main class (MainClass.java) which sets up the OOPGraphics class correctly. You should
call the “about()” method in OOPGraphics which will output a simple graphic.
